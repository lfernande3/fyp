# Sleep-based Low-latency Access M2M Communication

## Project Overview

Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications is one of the most important enabling technologies for the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm that has found wide applications in various domains such as smart grid, intelligent transportation, and e-health. 

For M2M communications, battery-driven Machine-Type Devices (MTDs) are expected to work for a long time without human intervention. To prolong the battery lifetime, sleep mechanisms have been widely adopted, which nevertheless cause substantial latency as packets that arrive during the sleep period may not be delivered in time. 

On the other hand, to support mission-critical services, the latency requirements of M2M communications are usually orders-of-magnitude higher than that of the conventional Human-to-Human (H2H) communications, with the number of MTDs orders-of-magnitude larger. It is therefore of great importance to study how to properly incorporate sleep into access schemes to facilitate low-latency access of M2M communications with longevity.

## Objectives

In this project, we will build a queueing-theoretical framework to analyze the delay performance of representative sleep-based access schemes and identify the effects of key sleep and access parameters. We aim to optimize the sleep-based access design for various objectives of delay and longevity of M2M communications.
